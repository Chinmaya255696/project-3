# Console 
[Deployed Link](https://656cdfd6cb669e40f75bbeca--delicate-chebakia-2e0ee8.netlify.app/)

A simple web page featuring a console-like interface that allows users to input a number via a prompt. The page then displays various calculations based on the provided number, including whether it is prime, the Fibonacci series, whether it is a strong number or an Armstrong number, its factorial, and its equivalent temperature in Celsius if it represents Fahrenheit.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. A prompt will appear asking you to enter a number.
3. Enter a number and click "OK" to see various calculations based on the provided number.
4. The results will be displayed in the black output box.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the console web page.
- **README.md**: The readme file providing information about the project.

## Styling

The page features a minimalistic design with a black background for the output container and white text. The overall styling is clean and easy on the eyes.

## JavaScript Functions

The JavaScript code includes functions for checking if a number is prime, generating the Fibonacci series, determining if a number is a strong or Armstrong number, calculating factorial, and converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. The user input is obtained through the `window.prompt` method.
